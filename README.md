# why I made this
This is the project assigned by "Recursion", which is CS learning platform.

# Technology used
・HTML, CSS, Javascript
  - This is the web application only made by HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript without using any flameworks. 
 
 ・Object
  - To keep track of the data the user is holding such as the number or price of items, money or their age,
  the Object is used and it keep rendering data based the data in itself
  
・DOM manipulation 　
  - To display the data on the screen depending on the changing event, I used the DOM manipulation
  such as addEventListner, classList, innerHTML, getElementById, so on and so forth.
    
・Local storage
  - To save the user data and allow the user to log in and conitune to play the game from where the user left at, 
  I made the feature where when the user pushed the save button and reused the data when user is logged in.
  This can be achieved by using the local storage, which allows the user to store their data on the browser, and reuse it.
